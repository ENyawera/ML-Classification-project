Analyzing the water pumps functionality of Tanzania Wells

Project overview
Tanzania, a country facing challenges in providing clean water to its over 57 million population, struggles with maintaining and repairing existing water wells. This project focuses on constructing a classifier to predict the condition of water wells across the country. By leveraging data encompassing pump types, installation dates, and other pertinent features, the objective is to aid NGOs or the Tanzanian government in identifying wells necessitating repair or maintenance. This initiative aims to enhance water accessibility and availability for the population, especially in remote or underprivileged areas.


Problem Understanding:
Water wells in Tanzania are essential for providing clean water but often suffer breakdowns or inadequate maintenance, impacting water availability. With numerous dispersed wells, systematically identifying non-functional or deteriorating ones is challenging. This project seeks to address this issue by employing machine learning to predict well conditions, facilitating targeted interventions for enhancing water infrastructure.


Project objectives
The main aim is to create a machine learning classifier for predicting water well conditions in Tanzania, classifying wells as functional, needing repair, or non-functional based on historical data. This system aims to assist NGOs and the Tanzanian government in efficiently identifying wells requiring immediate maintenance, ultimately improving water accessibility, especially in underserved regions.


The data. 
In this project i will use data from drivendata.org -https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/data/
The data in the datasetcontains information from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water.
With over 59,000 data points.
